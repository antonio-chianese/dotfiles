# Vim Configuration
## File location
Files are ~/[file/directory_name], so it means that those are in the following path: /home/[user_name]/[file/directory_name]. This means that files and directories are located under your user directory.
## Access files in windows explorer
If using WSL, files are located in the following path (which uses the space of your main disk): \\wsl.localhost\[distribution_name]\home\[user_name]. In my case is the following: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\antonioc.
## Copying files in windows clipboard
Use the following command in the linux terminal: cat [file_name] | clip.exe
