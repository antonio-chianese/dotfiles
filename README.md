## File location
Files are ```~/[file/directory_name]```, so it means that those are in the following path: ```/home/[user_name]/[file/directory_name]```. So, files and directories you find here are located under your user directory.
## Access files in windows explorer
If using WSL, files are located in the following path (which uses the space of your main disk): ```\\wsl.localhost\[distribution_name]\home\[user_name]```. In my case is the following: ```\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\antonioc```.
## Copying files in windows clipboard
Use the following command in the linux terminal: ```cat [file_name] | clip.exe```.
